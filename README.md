### ✨ Key Analyses & Insights
 
This project explores the data from multiple angles to build a comprehensive business overview.

### 📈 Sales & Revenue Trends

We tracked sales over time to understand growth and seasonality. The overall trend is positive, though there are significant daily fluctuations.

### 🛍️ Product Performance & Pareto Analysis

The analysis confirms the 80/20 rule: a small number of products drive the majority of sales. This is crucial for inventory and marketing focus.

### 🌍 Geographic Hotspots

We identified the top 10 states and cities by sales volume, highlighting where the customer base is most concentrated. Maharashtra is a key market.

### 🔄 Returns & Fulfillment

A deep dive into returns helps identify problematic products. The scatter plot below spots items with low sales and high return rates—prime candidates for review.
